# Privacy Policy for Sudoku Collection App

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025

Kai ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Sudoku Collection App (the "App"). This Privacy Policy applies to our application, and its associated subdomains (collectively, our "Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

Our App is designed to be a fun and engaging puzzle experience. We do not require you to create an account or provide any directly identifiable personal information like your name, email address, or phone number to use the core features of the App.

However, to support the development and provide the App for free, we use third-party services that may collect information. The information we collect falls into two categories:

### 1. Game Progress Data (Stored Locally)

To provide features like "Continue Game," your game progress (such as the current puzzle state, time elapsed, and mistake count) is saved directly on your device using `UserDefaults`. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party and remains solely on your device. If you delete the App, this data is also deleted.

### 2. Advertising Data (Collected by Third-Party Services)

We partner with **Google AdMob**, a third-party advertising network, to display advertisements within the App. AdMob is a service provided by Google Inc.

To provide personalized and relevant advertising, Google AdMob may collect and process certain data, which may include:

*   **Identifiers:** Such as your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA or GAID).
*   **Device Information:** Including device type, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Coarse Location:** Approximate location derived from your IP address.
*   **App Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the App and the ads displayed, such as ad views and clicks.

In accordance with Apple's policies, the App will request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites through the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. Your consent allows us to provide a more personalized ad experience. If you do not consent, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

## How We Use Your Information

The data collected by our third-party advertising partner (Google AdMob) is used for the following purposes:

*   **To display advertisements** to support the App's development.
*   **To personalize the advertising content** you see.
*   **To measure the effectiveness** of advertising campaigns.
*   **To prevent fraud** and ensure the security of the advertising services.

We do not have direct access to the specific data collected by Google AdMob and do not use this data for any purpose other than displaying ads within the App.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share your locally stored game progress data with anyone.

The data collected by Google AdMob is handled according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies to understand how they handle your data:

*   **Google's Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

## Your Privacy Rights and Choices

You have control over the data collected for advertising purposes. You can:

*   **Manage Tracking Permission:** You can grant or revoke tracking permission at any time through your device's Settings app (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).
*   **Opt-out of Personalized Ads:** You can limit ad tracking on your iOS device by enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" in your device's settings.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
